Welcome to VectorChat, an innovative AI chatbot that uses GPT-4 and is optimized for learning and personal growth. The bot is based on Dave Shapiro's [Reflective Journaling Tool](https://github.com/daveshap/Reflective_Journaling_Tool), but VectorChat expands upon the original concept with the inclusion of vector processing capabilities. 

The more you interact with VectorChat, the more it adapts to your style, learning about you as you learn from it. Its dynamic nature makes it an excellent tool for a variety of applications, including task-directed or general chat purposes.

This project is a part of the exciting work we're doing at [Alignment Lab AI](https://alignmentlab.ai). You can check out a compilation of our projects at [Our Projects](https://github.com/Alignment-Lab-AI/Our-Projects) repository, where we're also granting access to special resources.

## Quick Start Guide for Python Teachers

To start using VectorChat:

1. Install the requirements by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Update the `user_profile.txt` file with information about the user.
3. Run the program with `python3 chat.py`.

## Customizing VectorChat's Personality

You can adjust the bot's personality to suit different applications. To do so:

1. Copy the content from the `System_Default.txt` file.
2. Paste it into a conversation with GPT-4.
3. Ask GPT-4 to "reformat this to be X oriented without breaking the basic features and structures in the text".

This allows you to guide the model's responses to align better with your desired orientation, making it a more versatile tool for your needs.
